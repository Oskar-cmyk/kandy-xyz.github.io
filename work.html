                        <p>The transformation of an obsolete stabiliser into an animal entity raises questions about the relationship between human beings, technology and nature. In a posthumanist view, the boundaries between device, animal and human are blurred. Technology allows the body to gradually lose its technological form and pass into an almost biological state. According to the concept of cosmism, it is the technological body that represents the only path for the further development of humanity. Here, the virtual and physical worlds merge, opening up a new understanding of movement and existence. The process is not easy - the body resists, its movements become uncontrolled, as if it wants to escape from cyberspace.
                        <br><br>
                        The body has become a hybrid being - no longer fully digital, but not fully physical either. It remains in an in-between space, as the cybernetic world is closer and more comprehensible to it than material reality.
                        <br><br>
                        Observation of this body reveals that it is not just a simulation - it is aware of its own movement, recognising its limits and possibilities. It also faces everyday challenges, such as finding the right path, the meaning of action or moments of inactivity.

                        <p>The work focused on stone research. I was interested in it because of its organic shape, which visually strongly resembles electronic noise. I tried various ways to represent this effect, but the results were not satisfactory enough to guide me further. So I took a different approach - instead of thinking about the structure of the stone, I tried to represent it using generative 3D modulation. <br><br>
                        In this way, I discovered a way where I can just map the stone and create something new, because its image is constantly changing and I never see it exactly the same. In this way I have created an image of a stone that is subconsciously close to me - one that I can imagine based on thousands of different stones.

                            The viewer remains a passive observer, unable to alter the unfolding events.  Drawing from observations of the ocean and utilizing mathematical models, the piece transforms data into simulations that act and appear realistic. <br>
                            The accompanying sound, which mirrors the visuals, intensifies the immersive digital experience.

                        <p>The arrbival of the Saharan sands reminded me once again of the global nature of our world. Fearing the danger of this, I created the work S4andWall, which is a flap that lifts up in case of danger. The machine protects us with a barrier against the sand. The work itself lives as a machine, its only function is to illustrate the protection of humans from a danger that only electronic devices can foresee.<br><br>

                            It receives its perception of danger through various sensors, which in their communication detect a noise that creates a certain dance of this machine, and thus it comes to life.<br><br>

                            The reason for using sensors and data that are not suitable for such a system is simply that it detects a kind of noise in the atmosphere that could endanger our lives.<br><br>

                            Thus, the machine sacrifices its existence to protect us, which destroys the machine more than it would destroy us.<br><br>

                            Most of the physical work is done by the machine, where it trims the metal, assembles the motors, microcontrollers, cables, bearings and screws. The rest of the part that is designed to hold the glass and move the hatch is created using a 3D printer. This way, most of the physical work is done by the machine, with the human only assisting where it is simpler and cheaper to do so. The work is thus created in the mode of human assistance to a machine device.

                        <p>SoundscapeParasite's work is an exploration of the creation of sound, which is not a composition without a beginning and an end, and its happening is constant.

                            The crashing of metal against metal plate creates a sound that can be heard in life as a kind of noise that we overhear. In doing so, it puts the emphasis on the everyday experience of the environment and the impact that sound has on us. The sound that is created causes us to see events and objects that we do not see. Working through silence increases the sense of the presence of noise in the room.

It becomes an appendage to our body, our touch turns into an intervention of the larger body, causing changes in its very existence.

                		<p>The title Avalanche_beta_1.3 was given to the work because of the way it originated.
                            It is created just like programs, endlessly flawed, but at the same time creates a sense of a holistic image.
                            Vague answers and open interpretation trigger an uneasy feeling of not knowing.
                            The avalanche is not supported by the audio recording of the actual avalanche,
                            but by the distorted tones of an unknown instrument. Together with the video, they form something unknown in everyday life.</p>

                            Anton Podbevšek poetry.
                            I was most impressed by the verse “sick hands feverish shooting”.
                            Quickly I got an idea how to show that scene. A poet wrote what
                            war looks like, without having experienced it, like him I created a
                            visual of how I imagine the war of the future.</p>
