       <h4>Oskar Kandare is a contemporary visual artist and a master's student of visual communication design, 
        majoring in photography, at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Ljubljana. His work explores cyberspace, 
        transience and the Anthropocene epoch, combining photography and time-based media with simulations that 
        challenge perceptions of reality. His aim is to evoke a sense of the unknown and to encourage viewers to 
        think about the future and our current state.
        <br> <br>
        He had exhibited at the Academy's student exhibitions, as part of the ATOL project at the Small 
        Gallery of the Bank of Slovenia, at the Alkatraz Gallery, at the MSUM student exhibition, as well as 
        in Austria, in Klagenfurt. In 2022, he expanded his artistic horizons with a work placement 
        within the Erasmus+ programme in Austria.
